# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space 
by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data 
and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.
