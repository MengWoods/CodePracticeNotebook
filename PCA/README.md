# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space 
by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data 
and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.
At an abstract level, take a dataset having many features, and simplify that dataset by selecting a few Principal Components from original features.

- PCA is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique.
- It is helpful for data visualization, speeding up machine learning training.
